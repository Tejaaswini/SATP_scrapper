Daily Excelsior reported on January 13 that security agencies have stepped up focus on human intelligence while going ahead with use of technology even as the Army proposed to launch Operation Sarvshakti on both sides of Pir Panjal range to finish off the terrorists in twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch which have witnessed surge in terror attacks since last year resulting into killing of 19 Army soldiers in four incidents. “After technology took centre-stage in tracing the terrorists and Over Ground Workers (OGWs), dependence of security agencies on human intelligence had come down though it wasn’t completely over. However, the adversary too took advantage of technology in keeping locations of the terrorists’ secret. With terror activities rising in Rajouri and Poonch, the focus has been back on human intelligence,’’ the officials said. The operations are being launched in close monitoring by the Army Headquarters and the Northern Army Command in Udhampur and were planned soon after Home Minister Amit Shah held a security meeting with all stakeholders including National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Army, intelligence agencies including both internal and external ones and police officials from Jammu and Kashmir and Central agencies in New Delhi on January 2. Army has also started the process of inducting more troops in the Rajouri-Poonch sector. The operations are expected to be on the lines of Operation Sarpvinash, which was launched in Hill Kaka in 2003 to eliminate terrorists in the South of Pir Panjal range.

Read more... The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) ‘central regional bureau (CRB)’ has described the January 16 PLGA (People's Liberation Guerilla Army) attack on the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Dharmavaram camp in Pamed area in the Bijapur District of Chhattisgarh state as ""unprecedented,"" reports Telangana Today on January 22. Its ‘spokesperson’ Pratap, in a statement released to the media on January 22, claimed the attack was a “befitting reply to the recently launched ‘Operation Kagaar-Surya Shakti’ by the Brahmanical Hindutva fascist rulers to eradicate the Maoist movement and to the ongoing onslaught on adivasis”. The PLGA fighters, along with thousands of revolutionary masses, executed the raid. In the three-hour raid, the guerillas fired more than 600 grenade launcher shells and other country-made grenades with rapid firings on the CRPF camp, he said. Pratap claimed that as many as 35 security personnel were killed and more than 40 were seriously injured. Prior to the raid, the guerillas took the entire periphery of the camp under their control. The locals disabled the movement of additional forces by blocking the roads with huge tree logs, and the militia kept landmines to attack the incoming forces. A Maoist ‘commander’ Devalu, ‘battalion member’ Vikram, and People’s ‘militia’ (people’s army of the Maoists) member Madkam Devalu were killed during the raid. Police officials, the State and Central governments were silent regarding the raid and trying to keep the details of casualties on their side in darkness, Pratap alleged. Police barricaded the total area, not allowing the journalists to cover the facts and figures of the raid. Thousands of police were deployed in Bastar division, particularly Narayanpur district, to establish several new advanced base camps. In order to keep their morale high, the higher officials were hiding the facts, Pratap said. Another reason for hiding the facts was that the newly elected BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) government in Chhattisgarh feared the opposition parties’ criticism of its failure to tackle the Maoists. The Centre also feared that the attack might divert public attention from the Ram Janmabhoomi temple consecration, Pratap alleged, adding that the BJP government was hiding the facts in view of the upcoming 2024 general election and to preserve its power at the Centre.

Reviewing the Naxal situation in Chhattisgarh, Shah also directed the Security Forces (SFs) to financially choke the ultras. He also directed the officials to prepare a blueprint to end Naxalism. Supporters of Naxalism have to be identified and completely choked financially, Shah added. The UHM said all kinds of help will be ensured to the SFs and agencies operating in Chhattisgarh. The SFs have to bring the plan to the ground and end Naxalism completely. He also stressed the need for expediting development in Naxal-affected areas. All welfare schemes of the central and state governments have to be implemented in these areas with renewed vigour. According to Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) estimates, incidents of Naxal violence have gone down by 52 per cent in the past 10 years, while deaths in these incidents declined by 70 per cent. The number of affected districts has come down from 96 to 45, and the number of LWE-hit Police Stations has declined from 495 to 176, the estimates showed. Last month, the UHM said that 199 new security force camps have been established in LWE-affected areas since 2019. “In the last 10 years of the Narendra Modi government, we have been able to win the battle in the hotspots of Jammu and Kashmir, Left Wing Extremism and insurgency in the northeast, and the security forces have been able to establish their domination in Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.

On February 10, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted raids at 15 locations across Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) as part of its crackdown on the proscribed Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) in a terror funding case, reports Daily Excelsior. The raids in the twin capitals of Srinagar and Jammu, along with Budgam in central and Kulgam and Anantnag in south Kashmir, led to the seizure of incriminating documents and digital devices connected with the activities of JeI and its related trusts and more than INR 2 million, a NIA spokesperson said, adding that two persons, identified as Dr. Shabir Hussain and Abdul Majeed Rather, were also detained in Jammu for questioning during the raids targeting a private school and its functionaries, including the chairman at Bagh-e-Bahu and Belicharana. Many items, including study material, electronic gadgets, etc., were seized during the raids. In Srinagar, the NIA teams, along with the Police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), raided the houses of Javid Ahmad Haroon, Mohammad Rafiq Wani, and Javed Hakeem. Three mobile phones, financial documents, and the identity card of Hakeem were seized.

The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) has earmarked ‘nine zones’ across India to expand Left-Wing ideology, mobilize masses, and trigger internal disturbances to topple the government, reports The Times of India on February 10. A classified document on Maoist infiltration of urban areas underlines a ‘long-term’ vision of the Maoists to use cities as launchpads to wage a camouflaged war against the ruling establishment. While expanding their urban network, Maoists are also tapping former arrested cadres and surrendered guerrillas to gain insight into the functioning of intelligence agencies, interrogation techniques of Security Forces (SFs), and their unit strengths, hierarchies, and workstations. The zones outlined across India, as per Maoist plan, have been identified as the Ahmedabad-Pune corridor, Delhi region, Bengaluru, Chennai, Coimbatore-Erode belt, Hyderabad, Kolkata, industrial cities of central India, and cities of the Gangetic plain. The four top cities of India on their radar are industrialized cities of Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Pune, and Surat, which are part of the ‘Ahmedabad-Pune corridor’. The neighbouring cities of Amravati and Gondia are also included in zones of the ‘industrial cities of 'Central India’ where Maoists plan to focus on employee unions and associations for infiltration and agitation.

A Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) camp on the Bijapur-Dantewada border in Chhattisgarh was busted by Security Forces (SFs) following two encounters with the Maoists, reports NDTV on February 22. The operation was part of an anti-Naxal [Left Wing Extremism, LWE] operation launched by a joint team of the District Reserve Guard (DRG) of Bijapur and Dantewada, the Special Task Force (STF), and the 202nd battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force's (CRPF’s) elite Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) on February 20, an official said. The operation was launched following a tip-off about the presence of 70–80 Maoists of the 'Gangalur area committee' of the outlawed CPI-Maoist in the hills of Pidiya and Itawar villages on the Bijapur–Dantewada border, said Bijapur Superintendent of Police (SP) Jitendra Kumar Yadav.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) charged one more accused person in connection with a 2019 case related to the interception and seizure of prohibited arms and ammunition in Purnea, Bihar, which was smuggled into the country via the Myanmar border, reports The Hindu on February 21. The accused has been identified as Bhikhan Ganju, ‘zonal commander’ of the Tritiya Prastuti Committee (TPC), a splinter group of the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist), a resident of Chatra in Jharkhand.

The agency has so far arrested nine people in the case and filed chargesheets against eight of them. The Bihar Police initially registered a First Information Report (FIR) on February 7, 2019, after the contraband of sophisticated illegal weapons was intercepted.

Uncovering the truth behind the alleged Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) wall writings that were recently found in Siddipet District, Thoguta Police found that a man had written a banner and, on a wall, used the name of Maoists just to save his land from being taken over by Hetero Pharmaceuticals Limited, reports Telangana Today on March 14. The banner and wall writings were found on March 10 at Pedda Masanpally village in Thoguta Mandal (administrative division). In the name of Maoists, the accused had attempted to threaten the Hetero management. According to the Police, the family of Bonala Raju (34), who was working as a driver in Hyderabad, had six acres of land at Pedda Masanpally. However, his parents sold four acres and 23 guntas to Hetero in 2014. The family was cultivating a little over one acre. Since the family had no documents of the land in their possession, the Hetero management allegedly took that land too into their possession. The management of Hetero had refused to leave the piece of land to Raju’s family, even after several requests. The Police said that Raju, with the support of his friend Yash Ajay Mahat, wrote the banner and, on the wall, threatened the management on March 9 at midnight. The two were produced before court and remanded in judicial custody.

The outfit blamed the long-standing negligence of the Meghalaya government in relocating the Harijans from the area and said: “We have no choice but to resort to military action. This serves as a gentle reminder that if the government fails to protect our community, we may see Hynniewtrep descend into civil war.

The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DSZC) expressed its readiness for ‘peace talks’ with the Chhattisgarh government, reports Telangana Today on March 21. Committee ‘spokesperson’ Vikalp, in a statement released to the media, said the Maoists were always ready for ‘peace talks’ for the welfare of the suppressed sections and to establish peace. He made it clear that if the government creates an amicable environment, they will come forward for peace talks. He stated that Chhattisgarh Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma was issuing statements on the government’s keenness to hold ‘peace talks’ with Maoists. But he could not come clear on the DSZC’s concerns and the measures conducive for ‘peace talks’. Vikalp wanted the government to stop alleged fake encounters, militarisation of tribal hamlets to confine armed forces to barracks for six months and to establish new Police camps in the villages for the talks to happen. He also asked intellectuals, journalist community, labour, women and people’s organisations and other concerned sections to put pressure on Chhattisgarh government to create a harmonious situation for the ‘peace talks’. If the government fails to do so, the public should raise their voice against its ‘Operation Kagar’ and anti-people policies.

Read more... Two top-ranking cadres of the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist), who were involved in ambushes that killed at least 140 security personnel, each carrying an INR 800,000 bounty, surrendered before Police in Sukma District in the Bastar Division of Chhattisgarh on April 5, reports The Times of India. One of them, a woman cadre named Pedakam Rita, was with the People's Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA) battalion 1, while the other surrendered Maoist, identified as Kalmu Prakash alias Sannu, was a ‘divisional committee member (DCM)’ of the south Bastar unit. Rita is a native of Mangalguda in Kistaram, next to the Telangana border, and joined the Maoists as an Indravati squad member in 2006. She was with the PLGA No. 1 battalion from 2010 to 2012 and was promoted from party member to ‘commander’ to the People's Party Committee Member (PPCM) post in December 2012, the Police said. Armed with an INSAS (Indian Small Arms System) assault rifle, she was involved in several deadly attacks, including the Tadmetla ambush of 2010 [in which 76 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed], the Potakpalli encounter of 2014 (13 personnel killed), and the Pidmel encounter in 2015 (seven STF personnel killed), said the Police. Sannu, a native of Baiyanpalli Tekapara in Jagargunda, joined the Maoists as a teenager in 2007. He was initially with the Nagaram Local Organisation Squad (LOS) and rose to be a ‘DCM’. He was armed with a Self-Loading Rifle (SLR), an INSAS assault rifle, and an AK-47 at separate times and worked for the Jagargunda and Kistaram area committees. He was involved in several attacks on Security Forces (SFs), including the Burkapal and Minpa ambushes of 2017 and 2020 that killed 42 CRPF personnel. According to Superintendent of Police (SP) Kiran Chavan, both of them said that the establishment of security camps in the interiors of Bastar division was creating a lot of pressure on Maoists, pushing them on the backfoot. They said they were fed up with “atrocities and discrimination” by senior Maoists from other states and no longer wanted to hurt local tribals, said the SP.

The EAM added that it was because India had not worked to ""delegitimize terrorism"" and convince the world that it is a danger for everyone globally.

The UMHA said, “LTTE sympathisers living abroad continue to spread anti-India propaganda among Tamils, holding the Government of India responsible for the defeat of the LTTE, which, if not checked, is likely to develop a sense of hate among Tamil populace towards the Central government and the Indian Constitution.” The LTTE was last banned on May 14, 2019. “Despite the ban in force, the activities of pro-LTTE organisations and individuals have come to notice and, attempts have been made by these forces to extend their support to the LTTE; the LTTE leaders, operatives and supporters have been inimically opposed to India’s policy on their organisation and action of the state machinery in curbing their activities,” the UMHA notification said.

Jayaprakash said the State Government had revised the surrender policy by increasing the cash component and other facilities for those who surrender. “So far, 14 persons have surrendered in Karnataka. Many of them are engaged in various struggles in the democratic setup,” he said. The armed struggle would not bring desired changes in society, due to various reasons. Moreover, the violent path adopted by the Naxals resulted in the death of many Dalits, Adivasis and many highly intelligent persons. “We are here to convey that if you are looking for an easy way to assimilate with the mainstream, the committee is willing to help you.

Booby traps that were being planted by the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) party in the forests on the Telangana-Chhattisgarh borders have been posing a threat to the lives of adivasis, said the Bhadradri Kothagudem District Police, reports Telangana Today on June 11. Adivasis and their cattle, as well as their pets, were either getting killed or severely injured due to booby traps. It might be recalled that a dalit, Y Yesu, died when he stepped on a landmine planted by Maoists on the Karregutta hillock of Kongala forests in Venkatapuram Mandal (administrative subdivision) of Mulugu District on June 3. Similarly, two adivasi women suffered grievous injuries on their legs when they stepped on booby traps at a border village called Bhimavaram, while two cows and two pet dogs of adivasis died at Pusuguppa in Cherla Mandal. Following complaints from Adivasis about the danger posed to their lives by booby traps in the Pusuguppa area, Police inspected the area and found 70 booby traps and cleared them. Police have removed as many as 4,396 iron spikes planted in the ground, according to Additional Superintendent of Police (SP), Operations, T. Sai Manohar, and Bhadrachalam Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Paritosh Pankaj. Innocent Adivasi people living in the border areas were living in perpetual distress due to the atrocities of Maoists. As the improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and booby traps planted by Maoists could cause harm to lives, tribals should be alert when they go into forests, they said.

The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) is locally manufacturing 12 bore cartridges made of iron and also using them as Barrel Grenade Launcher (BGL) ammunition in the forests of Narayanpur District to fight with Security Forces (SFs), officials said, adding that the cartridges were recovered in the recent encounter between the Maoists and the Narayanpur Police on June 7, reports Hindustan Times on June 11. On June 7, six Maoists, including three women, were killed in multiple encounters near Gobel and Thulthuli villages in the Orchha Police Station area. Police later claimed to have recovered two 303 rifles, one 315-bore rifle, 10 BGL (barrel grenade launcher) shells, one SLR magazine, a cooker bomb, five bags, and a huge cache of explosives, medicines, and items of daily use from the spot. “We have found these 12 bore iron cartridges from the recovery made on Friday (June 7), which they are probably using as ammunition for BGL or muzzle loading rifles. They are making it, and as iron is in abundance in Bastar, it is surely a matter of concern,” Sunderaj P., Inspector General of Police (IGP), Bastar Range, said. He said the police are waiting for a detailed ballistic analysis of these iron cartridges. “In the recent encounter in the East Bastar Division of the CPI (Maoist) area, some locally fabricated ammunition has been recovered. Prima facie, it appears to be ammunition to propel BGL shells. A detailed ballistic analysis would be done to find out more details in this regard,” Sunderaj said. “Earlier, they used to smuggle or get BGL and other ammunition easily, but now it is very difficult. It shows that they are lacking ammunition. Secondly, the forces use highly sophisticated weapons; these ammunitions are nowhere in front of what security forces have,” said another Indian Police Service (IPS) officer working in the region. “The frequent use of locally made BGL and its ammunition by Maoists is a matter of concern for the security forces. As the success rate of such BGLs has gradually increased, the forces must counter them with appropriate measures. However, it is a matter of satisfaction that they have not been able to breach the perimeter security of our camps, which are war zones in Bastar,” said RK Vij, former Special Director General of Police (SDGP), Chhattisgarh.

They promised to shut out Maoists, boycott their meetings, and ban their entry into villages, which are often used as launchpads for guerrilla operations, propagating ideology, or organising political and military training camps.

He said that the party would organize various programmes and events during the week to pay tribute to the martyrs. “In the last 6 months, 140 comrades have been martyred in Chhattisgarh alone. The Chhattisgarh government has launched a massive operation called Operation Kagar to suppress the Naxalites [Left Wing Extremists, LWEs], which the organization has termed as a conspiracy to loot the wealth and resources of the dalits and tribals. The central and state governments are trying to eliminate our organization, but it’s impossible. The central government has announced Operation Kagar to eradicate Naxalism from the country within the next 3 years. In this war of destruction, the police are the main enemy, who are torturing people, molesting them, and killing them without any reason,” maintained Ganesh. Ganesh also condemned the government’s Operation Kagar, which he said was aimed at eliminating the Naxalites. He alleged that the government was trying to crush the movement by killing innocent people and branding them as Naxalites.

On July 25, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested a senior Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) cadre, identified as Uday Ji alias Rajesh Kumar Sinha, in connection with its probe into a 2021 case linked to the seizure of arms, ammunition, and explosives in Bihar, reports The New Indian Express. The officials stated that Uday Ji, a Special Area Committee member of CPI-Maoist, has been arrested under various provisions of the Arms Act, the Explosive Substances Act, the Criminal Law Amendment Act, and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in the case, which the agency registered in June 2021. “Apart from arms, ammunition, and improvised hand grenades, several incriminating articles and equipment used in the manufacturing of arms and explosives, along with documents and materials, were seized at the time of the original registration of the case,” said a senior NIA official. These were recovered from Maoist operative Parshuram Singh alias Nandlal, who had visited a CPI-Maoist camp located in Budhapahad, Jharkhand, and met Mithilesh Mehta alias Mithilesh Verma alias Bhikhari alias Gehuda and supplied improvised hand grenades to them, the official said. In its investigation into the case, the official stated that Uday Ji was found instrumental in providing financial and logistics support to Parshuram Singh, who was manufacturing the improvised hand grenades at his garage in Danapur, Bihar. “These improvised hand grenades were further supplied to Naxals [Left Wing Extremists, LWEs] at Budhapahad. Investigations have revealed a huge conspiracy to supply arms, ammunition, and explosive materials to the banned organisation, CPI (Maoist),” the official added. In December 2021, the NIA filed a charge sheet in the case naming Parshuram Singh, Sanjay Singh, Rakesh Kumar, Prem Raj alias Gautam, and Md. Badruddin.

On July 25, the Peoples' Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) cadres and their supporters of the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) killed their former colleague, Jairam Gawade, labeling him as an 'informer' and dumped his body in the middle of the Arewada-Hiddur Road in Bhamragarh Taluka (revenue division) in Gadchiroli District of Maharashtra, reports to The Times of India. The rebels left behind a note near the body stating Gawade was handed out a ‘death sentence’ for being a ‘traitor’. Gawade was leading a peaceful life with his wife, Dewe Pungati alias Raso, as a farmer. The couple had joined the rebels in 2007 and surrendered in 2017. “The deceased was not a police informer. He had no links with anyone in the police. The Maoists probably murdered him as he had returned to the mainstream to live a peaceful life instead of following their violent ideology,” Superintendent of Police (SP) Gadchiroli Neelotpal said.

The Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) leadership allegedly killed Pallepati Radha alias Neelso alias Banti Radha, a female cadre who worked as a ‘protection team commander’ in the Andhra-Odisha Border (AOB) area, branding her as a ‘police informer’ in a forest area near Chennapuram in Cherla Mandal (an administrative subdivision) in Bhadradri Kothagudem District of Telangana on August 21, reports Telangana Today. In a letter purportedly written by the Maoists which was found on the woman's body, she was accused of being an ‘informer’ of the Police. ""The decision was taken by the Naxals [Left Wing extremists, LWEs] committee to eliminate her,"" it stated. Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee (AOBSZC) secretary Ganesh, in a statement released to the media, alleged that intelligence officials of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Chhattisgarh Police planned to damage Maoists by identifying ideologically weak cadres in the party and organising them as covert operatives to obtain information. As part of their plan, the Police trapped Radha and made her work for them. Neelso, who hails from Balaji Nagar (new Indira Nagar) near ECIL in Hyderabad, joined the Maoists in 2018 voluntarily. For the last six years, she served as a Dalam member, a ‘military instructor’, and a ‘protection team commander’. She was removed from the position of ‘commander’ because of her indiscipline and crossing of the party line regarding marriage and man-woman relationships. It resulted in the end of her revolutionary life, Ganesh said.

While chairing the review meeting of the inter-state coordination committee in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, UHM Shah said, “The fight against the Maoists has reached its final stage, and the country will be free from the Maoist problem by March 2026. The top 14 Maoist leaders were neutralised. From 2014 to 24, there were a minimum number of cases related to Maoists registered.” Shah said that the strategy to counter the Maoists had twin objectives. ""First, the efforts were directed to establish rule of law in the Maoist-affected areas, and second, to develop the area that witnessed destruction,” he stated. The Home Minister cited Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra as the states that are now free from the Maoist menace and claimed it as one of the big achievements of the Central government. “From 2004 to 2014, there were 16,463 Maoist-related incidents, and from 2014 till now 7,744 naxal disturbances - a 53 per cent drop, had occurred. 6,617 security personnel and civilians died during 2004-2014 and later there was a decrease by 70 per cent restricting the figure of deaths of both security personnel and civilians compared to 2004”, he said.
